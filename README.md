# BME450-project
Title: Recipe Generator Model
Team Members: Kashyap Akkinapally, Ethan Moy, Andrew Meacham
Project Description: 

The following project takes an image which has vegetables, detects the vegetables, and returns a recipe that utilizes the vegetables in the image. This project utilizes image processing techniques to transform the image and increase processing effectiveness while also implementing machine learning algorithms to classify the vegetables. To train the vegetable classification, a dataset from Kaggle, created by Misrak Ahmed, with 15 classes of vegetables and over 15,000 images. The machine learning library used is PyTorch.
